## Usage

### Making a Reservation

To create a reservation, you can use the `Igniter\Reservation\Classes\BookingManager` class. The class provides methods to create a reservation, generate reservation time slots and get the next available bookable table.

```php
use Igniter\Reservation\Classes\BookingManager;

$bookingManager = resolve(BookingManager::class);

$reservation = $bookingManager->loadReservation();

$reservation = $bookingManager->saveReservation($reservation, $attributes);
```

The `$attributes` array may contain the following keys:

- `guest`: _(integer)_ The number of guests for the reservation.
- `first_name`: _(string)_ The first name of the customer.
- `last_name`: _(string)_ The last name of the customer.
- `email`: _(string)_ The email address of the customer.
- `telephone`: _(string)_ The telephone number of the customer.
- `comment`: _(string)_ The customer's comment for the reservation.
- `sdateTime`: _(string|DateTime)_ The reservation date and time.

### Generating reservation time slots

To generate reservation time slots, you can use the `makeTimeSlots` method on the booking manager instance. The method accepts three parameters: the `Carbon` instance for the current date, the interval in minutes, and lead time in minutes. The method returns an array of `DateTime` objects.

```php
$timeslots = $bookingManager->makeTimeSlots($date, $interval, $leadTime);
```

Both the `$interval` and `$leadTime` parameters are optional. The method will default to the reservation time interval and lead time configured in the admin area.

For more information on generating schedule time slots, see the [Local Extension](https://tastyigniter.com/marketplace/item/igniter-local#working-hours) documentation.

### Assigning tables

To assign tables to a reservation, you can use the `assignTable` method on the reservation model instance. The method automatically assigns tables to the reservation based on the reservation time, the number of guests and available tables.

```php
$reservation->assignTable();
```

You may also manually assign tables to a reservation using the `addReservationTables` method on the reservation model instance. The method accepts an array of table IDs as the first parameter.

```php
$reservation->addReservationTables($tableIds);
```

### Updating a reservation status

You can update a reservation status using the `addStatusHistory` method on the reservation model instance. The method accepts the status model instance as the first parameter and the status data array as the second parameter.

```php
$reservation->addStatusHistory($status, $statusData);
```

The `$statusData` array may contain the following keys:

- `staff_id`: The staff ID who updated the reservation status.
- `comment`: The comment for the reservation status update.
- `notify`: Whether to notify the customer of the reservation status update.

### Assigning staff members

You can assign staff members to an reservation using the `assignTo` method on the reservation model instance. The method accepts an instance of the `Igniter\User\Models\UserGroup` model as the first parameter and the `Igniter\User\Models\User` model as the second parameter.

```php
use Igniter\User\Models\User;
use Igniter\User\Models\UserGroup;

$staff = User::find(1);
$group = UserGroup::find(1);

$reservation->updateAssignTo($group, $staff);
```

### Cancelling a reservation

You can cancel a reservation using the `markAsCanceled` method on the reservation model instance. The method updates the reservation status to canceled reservation status configured in the admin area. The method accepts the `$statusData` array as the first parameter.

```php
$reservation->markAsCanceled($statusData);
```

The `$statusData` array may contain the following keys:

- `staff_id`: The staff ID who canceled the reservation.
- `comment`: The reason for canceling the reservation.
- `notify`: Whether to notify the customer of the reservation cancellation.
